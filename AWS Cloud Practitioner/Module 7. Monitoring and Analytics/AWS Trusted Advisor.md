[**AWS Trusted Advisor**(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/) is a web service that inspects your AWS environment and provides real-time recommendations in accordance with AWS best practices.

Trusted Advisor compares its findings to AWS best practices in five categories: cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits. For the checks in each category, Trusted Advisor offers a list of recommended actions and additional resources to learn more about AWS best practices. 

The guidance provided by AWS Trusted Advisor can benefit your company at all stages of deployment. For example, you can use AWS Trusted Advisor to assist you while you are creating new workflows and developing new applications. You can also use it while you are making ongoing improvements to existing applications and resources.
