Within CloudTrail, you can also enable [**CloudTrail Insights**(opens in a new tab)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html). This optional feature allows CloudTrail to automatically detect unusual API activities in your AWS account. 

For example, CloudTrail Insights might detect that a higher number of Amazon EC2 instances than usual have recently launched in your account. You can then review the full event details to determine which actions you need to take next.
