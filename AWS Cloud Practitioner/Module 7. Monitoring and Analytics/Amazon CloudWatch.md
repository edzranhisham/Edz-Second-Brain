[**Amazon CloudWatch**(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics and configure alarm actions based on data from those metrics.

CloudWatch uses [**metrics**(opens in a new tab)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html) to represent the data points for your resources. AWS services send metrics to CloudWatch. CloudWatch then uses these metrics to create graphs automatically that show how performance has changed over time.
