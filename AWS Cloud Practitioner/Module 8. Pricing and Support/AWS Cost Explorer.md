[**AWS Cost Explorer**(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) is a tool that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report of the costs and usage for your top five cost-accruing AWS services. You can apply custom filters and groups to analyze your data. For example, you can view resource usage at the hourly level.

By analyzing your AWS costs over time, you can make informed decisions about future costs and how to plan your budgets.
