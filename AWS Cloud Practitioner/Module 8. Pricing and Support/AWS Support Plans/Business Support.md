Customers with a **Business Support** plan have access to additional features, including: 

- Use-case guidance to identify AWS offerings, features, and services that can best support your specific needs
- All AWS Trusted Advisor checks
- Limited support for third-party software, such as common operating systems and application stack components

Suppose that your company has the Business Support plan and wants to install a common third-party operating system onto your Amazon EC2 instances. You could contact AWS Support for assistance with installing, configuring, and troubleshooting the operating system. For advanced topics such as optimizing performance, using custom scripts, or resolving security issues, you may need to contact the third-party software provider directly.
