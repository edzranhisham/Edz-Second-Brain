The [**AWS Pricing Calculator**(opens in a new tab)](https://calculator.aws/#/) lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center.

When you have created an estimate, you can save it and generate a link to share it with others.

Suppose that your company is interested in using Amazon EC2. However, you are not yet sure which AWS Region or instance type would be the most cost-efficient for your use case. In the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can enter details, such as the kind of operating system you need, memory requirements, and input/output (I/O) requirements. By using the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can review an estimated comparison of different EC2 instance types across AWS Regions.
