With Amazon EC2, you pay for only the compute time that you use while your instances are running.

For some workloads, you can significantly reduce Amazon EC2 costs by using Spot Instances. For example, suppose that you are running a batch processing job that is able to withstand interruptions. Using a Spot Instance would provide you with up to 90% cost savings while still meeting the availability requirements of your workload.

You can find additional cost savings for Amazon EC2 by considering Savings Plans and Reserved Instances.

The service charges in this example include details for the following items:

- Each Amazon EC2 instance type that has been used
- The amount of Amazon EBS storage space that has been provisioned
- The length of time that Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) has been used

In this example, all the usage amounts are under the thresholds in the AWS Free Tier, so the account owner would not have to pay for any Amazon EC2 usage in this month.
