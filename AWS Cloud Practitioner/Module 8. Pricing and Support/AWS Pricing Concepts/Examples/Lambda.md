For AWS Lambda, you are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the time that it takes for them to run.

AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.

You can save on AWS Lambda costs by signing up for a Compute Savings Plan. A Compute Savings Plan offers lower compute costs in exchange for committing to a consistent amount of usage over a 1-year or 3-year term. This is an example of **paying less when you reserve**.


If you have used AWS Lambda in multiple AWS Regions, you can view the itemized charges by Region on your bill. 

In this example, all the AWS Lambda usage occurred in the Northern Virginia Region. The bill lists separate charges for the number of requests for functions and their duration. 

Both the number of requests and the total duration of requests in this example are under the thresholds in the AWS Free Tier, so the account owner would not have to pay for any AWS Lambda usage in this month.
