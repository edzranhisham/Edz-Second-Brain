To allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC, you attach an **internet gateway** to the VPC.

An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet. You can think of an internet gateway as being similar to a doorway that customers use to enter the coffee shop. Without an internet gateway, no one can access the resources within your VPC.
