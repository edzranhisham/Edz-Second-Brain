An **edge location** is a site that **Amazon CloudFront** uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery. AWS Edge locations run Amazon CloudFront to help get content closer to your customers, no matter where they are in the world.

You don't need to build an entire new headquarters or from an IT perspective, if you have customers in Mumbai who need access to your data, but the data is hosted out of the Tokyo Region, rather than having all the Mumbai-based customers, send requests all the way to Tokyo, to access the data, just place a copy locally or cache a copy in Mumbai. Caching copies of data closer to the customers all around the world uses the concept of content delivery networks, or CDNs.

But what if your business wants to use, AWS services inside their own building? Well sure. AWS can do that for you. Introducing **AWS Outposts**, where AWS will basically install a fully operational mini Region, right inside your own data center. That's owned and operated by AWS, using 100% of AWS functionality, but isolated within your own building. It's not a solution most customers need, but if you have specific problems that can only be solved by staying in your own building, we understand, AWS Outposts can help.
