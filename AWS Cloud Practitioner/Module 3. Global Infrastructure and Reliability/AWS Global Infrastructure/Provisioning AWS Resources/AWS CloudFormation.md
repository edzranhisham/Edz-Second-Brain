Another service you can use to help create automated and repeatable deployments is AWS CloudFormation. AWS CloudFormation is an infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define a wide variety of AWS resources in a declarative way using JSON or YAML text-based documents called CloudFormation templates. A declarative format like this allows you to define what you want to build without specifying the details of exactly how to build it. CloudFormation lets you define what you want and the CloudFormation engine will worry about the details on calling APIs to get everything built out.

It also isn't just limited to EC2-based solutions. CloudFormation supports many different AWS resources from storage, databases, analytics, machine learning, and more. Once you define your resources in a CloudFormation template, CloudFormation will parse the template and begin provisioning all the resources you defined in parallel. CloudFormation manages all the calls to the backend AWS APIs for you. You can run the same CloudFormation template in multiple accounts or multiple regions, and it will create identical environments across them. There is less room for human error as it is a totally automated process.
