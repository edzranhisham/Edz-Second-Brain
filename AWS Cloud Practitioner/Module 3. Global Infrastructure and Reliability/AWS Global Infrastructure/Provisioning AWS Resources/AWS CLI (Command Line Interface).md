To save time when making API requests, you can use the **AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)**. AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool. AWS CLI is available for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

By using AWS CLI, you can automate the actions that your services and applications perform through scripts. For example, you can use commands to launch an Amazon EC2 instance, connect an Amazon EC2 instance to a specific Auto Scaling group, and more.

Writing commands using the CLI makes actions scriptable and repeatable. So, you can write and run your commands to launch an EC2 Instance. And if you want to launch another, you can just run the pre-written command again. This makes it less susceptible to human error. And you can have these scripts run automatically, like on a schedule or triggered by another process.

Automation is very important to having a successful and predictable cloud deployment over time.
