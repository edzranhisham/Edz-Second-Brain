AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that helps you provision Amazon EC2-based environments. Instead of clicking around the console or writing multiple commands to build out your network, EC2 instances, scaling and Elastic Load Balancers, you can instead provide your application code and desired configurations to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service, which then takes that information and builds out your environment for you. 

AWS Elastic Beanstalk also makes it easy to save environment configurations, so they can be deployed again easily. 

AWS Elastic Beanstalk gives you the convenience of not having to provision and manage all of these pieces separately, while still giving you the visibility and control of the underlying resources. 
You get to focus on your business application, not the infrastructure.
