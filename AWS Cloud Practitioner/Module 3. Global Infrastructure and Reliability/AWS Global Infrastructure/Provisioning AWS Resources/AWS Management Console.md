The **AWS Management Console** is a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services. You can quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym. The console includes wizards and automated workflows that can simplify the process of completing tasks.  
  
You can also use the AWS Console mobile application to perform tasks such as monitoring resources, viewing alarms, and accessing billing information. Multiple identities can stay logged into the AWS Console mobile app at the same time.

However, once you are up and running in a production type environment, you don't want to rely on the point and click style that the console gives you to create and manage your AWS resources. For example, in order to create an Amazon EC2 Instance, you need to click through various screens, setting all the configurations you want, and then you launch your instance. If later, you wanted to launch another EC2 Instance, you would need to go back into the console and click through those screens again to get it up and running. By having humans do this sort of manual provisioning, you're opening yourself up to potential errors. It's pretty easy to forget to check a checkbox or misspell something when you are doing everything manually.
