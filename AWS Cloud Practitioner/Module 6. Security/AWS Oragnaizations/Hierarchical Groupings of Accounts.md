Implement hierarchical groupings of your accounts to meet security, compliance, or budgetary needs. This means you can group accounts into organizational units, or OUs, kind of like business units, or BUs. 

For example, if you have accounts that must access only the AWS services that meet certain regulatory requirements, you can put those accounts into one OU, or if you have accounts that fall under the developer OU, you can group them accordingly.
