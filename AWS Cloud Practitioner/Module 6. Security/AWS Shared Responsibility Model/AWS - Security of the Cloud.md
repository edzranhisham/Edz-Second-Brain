AWS is responsible for security _of_ the cloud.

AWS operates, manages, and controls the components at all layers of infrastructure. This includes areas such as the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and even the physical security of the data centers from which services operate. 

AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure includes AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations.

AWS manages the security of the cloud, specifically the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources, which include:

- Physical security of data centers
- Hardware and software infrastructure
- Network infrastructure
- Virtualization infrastructure

Although you cannot visit AWS data centers to see this protection firsthand, AWS provides several reports from third-party auditors. These auditors have verified its compliance with a variety of computer security standards and regulations.
