[**AWS WAF**(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/waf) is a web application firewall that lets you monitor network requests that come into your web applications. 

AWS WAF works together with Amazon CloudFront and an Application Load Balancer. Recall the network access control lists that you learned about in an earlier module. AWS WAF works in a similar way to block or allow traffic. However, it does this by using a [**web access control list (ACL)**(opens in a new tab)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl.html) to protect your AWS resources.
