Do **not** use the root user for everyday tasks. 

Instead, use the root user to create your first IAM user and assign it permissions to create other users.

Then, continue to create other IAM users, and access those identities for performing regular tasks throughout AWS. Only use the root user when you need to perform a limited number of tasks that are only available to the root user. Examples of these tasks include changing your root user email address and changing your AWS support plan. For more information, see “Tasks that require root user credentials” in the [AWS Account Management Reference Guide(opens in a new tab)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html).
