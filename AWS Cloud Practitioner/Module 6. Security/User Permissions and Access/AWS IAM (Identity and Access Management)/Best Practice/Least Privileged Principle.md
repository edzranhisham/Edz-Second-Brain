Follow the security principle of **least privilege** when granting permissions. 

By following this principle, you help to prevent users or roles from having more permissions than needed to perform their tasks. 

For example, if an employee needs access to only a specific bucket, specify the bucket in the IAM policy. Do this instead of granting the employee access to all of the buckets in your AWS account.
