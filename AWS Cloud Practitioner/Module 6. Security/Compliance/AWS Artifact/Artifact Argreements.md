Suppose that your company needs to sign an agreement with AWS regarding your use of certain types of information throughout AWS services. You can do this through **AWS Artifact Agreements**. 

In AWS Artifact Agreements, you can review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in AWS Organizations. Different types of agreements are offered to address the needs of customers who are subject to specific regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
