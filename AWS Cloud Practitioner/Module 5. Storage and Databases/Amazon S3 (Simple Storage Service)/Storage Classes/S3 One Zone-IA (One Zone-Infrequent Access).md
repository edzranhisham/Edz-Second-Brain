- Stores data in a single Availability Zone
- Has a lower storage price than Amazon S3 Standard-IA

Compared to S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA, which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones, S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone. This makes it a good storage class to consider if the following conditions apply:

- You want to save costs on storage.
- You can easily reproduce your data in the event of an Availability Zone failure.
