[**Amazon Redshift**(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift) is a data warehousing service that you can use for big data analytics. It offers the ability to collect data from many sources and helps you to understand relationships and trends across your data.

Not just the volume, but the variety of data can be a problem. You want to run business intelligence or BI projects against data coming from different data stores like your inventory, your financial, and your retail sales systems? A single query against multiple databases sounds nice, but traditional databases don't handle them easily. 

Once data becomes too complex to handle with traditional relational databases, you've entered the world of data warehouses. Data warehouses are engineered specifically for this kind of big data, where you are looking at historical analytics as opposed to operational analysis.
