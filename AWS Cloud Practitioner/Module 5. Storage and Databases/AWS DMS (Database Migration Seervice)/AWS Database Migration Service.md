[**AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)**(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/) enables you to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases, and other types of data stores.

With AWS DMS, you move data between a source database and a target database. [The source and target databases(opens in a new tab)](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/resources) can be of the same type or different types. During the migration, your source database remains operational, reducing downtime for any applications that rely on the database. 

For example, suppose that you have a MySQL database that is stored on premises in an Amazon EC2 instance or in Amazon RDS. Consider the MySQL database to be your source database. Using AWS DMS, you could migrate your data to a target database, such as an Amazon Aurora database.
