• **Trade capital expense for variable expense** – Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers
and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume
computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
• **Benefit from massive economies of scale** – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower
variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers
is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which
translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
• **Stop guessing capacity** – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a
capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle
resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can
access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few
minutes’ notice.
• **Increase speed and agility** – In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away,
which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from
weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost
and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
• **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers** – Focus on projects that differentiate
your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather
than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.
• **Go global in minutes** – Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just
a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at
minimal cost.
