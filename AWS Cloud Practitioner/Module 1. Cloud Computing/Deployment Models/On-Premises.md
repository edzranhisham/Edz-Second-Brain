- Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
- Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.

**O****n-premises deployment** is also known as a _private cloud_ deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.  
  

For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center. Though this model is much like legacy IT infrastructure, its incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increase resource utilization.
